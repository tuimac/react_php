This repository is for creating small application with react, php, dynamodb on AWS.

## Development envirionment
Development environment consist of docker container. Editor is VSCode.

### React on Docker
Create simple frontend application, build that, push to S3.

### DB: DynamoDB
I try to use docker container for local dynamodb.(Link [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/dynamodb-local/))

There have already been skelton projects for PHP and React. So I created `init.sh` to create skelton project.
